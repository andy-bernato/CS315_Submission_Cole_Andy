            In all of his glory, King Dedede is easily one of the most fun experiences I've ever had playing Ult.
            As one of the games heaviest characters, he's incredibly hard to knock out, though the fact that he's 
            so large makes him effectively combo food. His best tools include Gordo, an incredibly volatile projectile
            that can often do more damage to you than an opponent, and the absolute power that is being absolutely
            demoralizing to lose to, hard as that may be.
        </p>
        <p>
            The King was my first character I really took seriously in the game, and as such, will always hold a special 
            place in my heart, though I have since moved on to other characters.
