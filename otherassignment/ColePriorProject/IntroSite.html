        <h3>
            Super Smash Bros Ultimate is quite possibly my most played game, 
            and I've gone through some phases when picking characters. <br>
            So, for the sake of posterity, I've decided to use this project
            to record this journey, for my sake, if nobody else's. <br> <br> <br>
            The first order of business, of course, is to figure out what makes
            a character fun for me.
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> Slow gameplan </li>
            <li> Ability to force interaction </li>
            <li> Uncommon character </li>
            <li> Projectiles and game stall </li>
        </ul>

        <p> The above characteristics are the keymark of my personal favorite
            types of characters.
            In game terms, these characters would typically be considered either "zoners" or "trappers,"
            depending on other factors. 
            I find that I enjoy each archetype pretty evenly however, meaning my time in Ult
            has been a journey through most of them. This'll be focusing on my main three.
        </p>
