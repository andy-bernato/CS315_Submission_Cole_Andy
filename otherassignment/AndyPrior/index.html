        I have to have this here for the assignment, but use the links at the bottom please.
        Also, it said we have to have a logo to return to home, and since this is all about Andrew,
        I'll use his face.

            <section>Andrew Ruff is a Junior
            Computer Science Major from Oletha, Kansas. He lives on campus, and is suitemates with my buddy Ethan. For fun,
            he likes to talk to his girlfriend, program things, and go to lunch with me at the SUB MWF after our Classical Greek
            Philosophy class. Some fun facts about him are that he really likes Arch Linux, he does a lot of computer science
            outside of class, he plays Piranha Plant in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate (but he does not play very often), and
            that he is the wrong soup (not to be confused with the right soup, an entity assumed to be our buddy Chris). 
            Also, I am in love with him.</section>
