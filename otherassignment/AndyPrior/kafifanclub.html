                <section style="align-content: center;">This is our friend Dr. Kafi, with my friends Andrew Ruff, JJ Gbekou, Akansha Negi,
                    Julian Williams, and Justin Caringal. Dr. Kafi is our friend because he is in this photo (people don't take photos
                    with people they aren't friends with). Some fun facts about Dr. Kafi is that his name is NOT based on Coffee (the 
                    caffeinated beverage) or Ramen (the Japanese noodle), he's the second longest standing professor in Truman CS,
                    and he hasn't added me back on LinkedIn. I cannot legally say I am in love with him because he is my professor
                    and that would get me in trouble, but I can say he's pretty cool.

                <section> Kafi couldn't send me a pdf for this part, so I'm using the assignment PDF instead.

        Since Kafi is special, I put his entire page in a footer, and then added another footer here. Also, this is
        required for the assignment, and this is the last page, so it only makes sense for the footer to foot the fan
        pages, in a somewhat footy manner. It also gives a special effect of having multiple colors, which is super special.
        All around a very special conclusion to some very special fanpages.
        <div>
            In the theme of shoehorning in extraneuous assignment things at the end, I'm leaving this here.
            This serves no other purpose other than to check the box on my to-do list saying I did this part.
            Thanks!
