            <article style="align-content: center;">This is me and my Bestest Buddy In the WHOLE World Cole Bracken. Some fun
            facts about Cole Bracken are that he dances a lot (and he's really good at it), he is something of a mysterious
            indvidual (wild sightings are rare), and it took five minutes of questioning to determine that it is "not necessarily
            inaccurate" to describe his favorite candy as a basic Hersheys bar. I am also MADLY in love with him, and would
            do anything for him.</article>

            despite the fact that he would probably rather die than compliment himself) Cole Bracken.</p>
