            Alex was the last one to send me this but by far had the funniest sends.
            This has further reaffirmed my love for Alex. I don't like the way the Lesser 
            Slow Lorris looks at me though (I think it wants violence)

        <article style="align-content: center;">This is me and my newer Dude Alex Switzer. Alex Switzer is many things to many
        people. To his girfriend Katie, a magnificent lover of seven years. To professors, he's a reliable, intelligent
        student that always gets his work done. To the boys, however, he's Schfifty, a trusted member of the Dudes
        and one of the active members of the CS boys. We don't know what we'd do without him. I'm mad at him now though
        cuz he changed his Discord name while I was writing this so I had to fix it :(. This should go without saying
        by now, but I am also also in love with him.</article>
