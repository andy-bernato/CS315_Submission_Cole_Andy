        I don't know if we actually have to have this on every page but just in case (and because I want Andrew's face
        on every page), it'll still be here.

            <section id="aidan">A-Nasty Dunne is a Junior Computer Science major from Columbia, Missouri. He lives
            off campus with his friends Ethan, Hattie, and Zoey. For fun, he likes to draw, swim, and be really cool. Some of
            the things I like about him are that his name rhymes with 'ton', he's really good at Jackbox, he has a class with my sister,
            and he says things are huge a lot (like "bro that's so huge" when something good happens).
            I am also madly in love with Aidan.</section>
