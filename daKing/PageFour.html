        <p>Oh, King DeDeDe, in my tipsy, happy state,
        I've had a few too many stars, I'm feeling great.
        You might be my rival, we've fought a million times,
        But tonight, I'm seeing you in neon-colored rhymes.</p>

        <p>You've swiped my cake, my apples, my dreams, oh my,
        But, DeDeDe, tonight, let's give peace a try.
        Your mallet's mighty, but your heart's kinda swell,
        In this fuzzy world, I'm under your kingly spell.</p>

        <p>I'll slur and stumble, but I'm here to say,
        That in this boozy haze, I think you're A-OK.
        Your castle's shiny, your laughs are big and bold,
        In this drunken love, our story will be told.</p>

        <p>So, DeDeDe, from my wobbly heart so pink,
        In this dizzy moment, let's share a drink.
        In Dream Land's starry sky, where we both might roam,
        I'll toast to you, my royal friend, in my tipsy home.</p>

        <p>Though we brawl and tussle, again and again,
        Tonight, let's be pals, let's make a toast, my friend.
        In this swirling world, where everything's just right,
        King DeDeDe, you're a true star tonight!</p>
